This project predicts Up/Down movement for Indian stocks (.NS tickers) using historical data,
trains a binary classifier (XGBoost), generates a four-section report (Fundamental / Technical / News & Sentiment / Peer Comparison),
and produces simulated live predictions with portfolio construction (mean-variance optimizer with volatility cap).
